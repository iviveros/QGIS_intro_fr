["installation.html", "Section 2 QGIS installation and Graphical User Interface 2.1 QGIS installation 2.2 QGIS Graphical User Interface", " Section 2 QGIS installation and Graphical User Interface 2.1 QGIS installation It is possible to install QGIS on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, and Android operating systems. The installers can be downloaded from this website, and this link provides detailed installation instructions. By the time of writing this document, the last version of QGIS is 3.8.2 Zanzibar, which was released on October 16, 2019. 2.2 QGIS Graphical User Interface The QGIS graphical user interface (GUI) is composed of: Menu bar: gives access to the main functionalities of QGIS. Toolbars: give a quick access to QGIS functionalities. Panels: they provide several functionalities, for instance managing layers, and browsing spatial data. Map display: shows the spatial data of the current project. Figure 2.1: QGIS GUI It is possible to customize the appearance of QGIS by navigating to View from the Menu bar. From here, you can select the panels and toolbars you want to display. I would recommend toggling the Processing Toolbox from the panel because it allows to quickly access to the main operations available in QGIS. "],
["loading-and-exporting-data.html", "Section 3 Loading and Exporting data 3.1 Importing data from text files 3.2 Importing data from KML files 3.3 Importing GeoJSON files 3.4 Saving a layer 3.5 Reprojecting a layer", " Section 3 Loading and Exporting data The quickest way to load data into QGIS is the technique drag-and-drop. It only requires locating the data you want to import into QGIS, select the file, and drop it on the Map display or on the layer panel. Another option for importing data is to use the browser panel. Navigate through the browser, locate the layer or data to be imported, right-click on it, and finally select Add Layer to Project. However, using the Manage Layers Toolbar or Add Layer from the Layer menu give more control on the importation. 3.1 Importing data from text files This recipe is illustrated with the coordonnees-stations-rsqa.csv file, which reports the locations of the stations of the Air Quality Monitoring Network (RSQA) set up in Montreal. The aim of the RSQA is to monitor the atmospheric concentration of criteria pollutants. Navigate to the Layer menu and select Add delimited text layer. The following dialog will pop up: Figure 3.1: Add delimited text layer window In the File Name field, indicate the path to the coordonnees-stations-rsqa.csv file. Figure 3.2: Indicating the path to the text file In the Geometry Definition section, indicate that point coordinates are being imported. Then indicate the corresponding fields for longitude and latitude. According to the sources of the layer being imported, the coordinate system is WGS 84, so we don’t need to change it. When you want to import an attribute table, you can select the option No geometry. Click on Add. You will see the following set of points, probably not in the same colour. Optionally, you can add a base map or another layer to give some spatial context, but for now we have successfully imported the layer corresponding to the stations of the RSQA network. Figure 3.3: Montreal’s Air Quality Monitoring Network In section 6.2 we describe how to add a basemap to add spatial context. Optional step: save the imported layer as a new shapefile (Section 3.4). 3.2 Importing data from KML files QGIS supports importing Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files. KML is the format used by Google Earth to show spatial data. The importation of a KML is illustrated with the grandparcs.kml file which contains polygons corresponding to the parks of Montreal. Navigate to the Layer menu and select Add vector layer. The following dialog will pop up: Figure 3.4: Add vector layer window In the File Name field, indicate the path to the grandparcs.kml file. The following layer will be displayed in QGIS: Figure 3.5: Montreal’s parks 3.3 Importing GeoJSON files GeoJSON is another frequently used format for storing and representing geographical attributes. This format is based on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The importation of a GeoJSON layer is illustrated with the ilotschaleur.json file. This file contains the urban heat islands (UHI) of Montreal. UHI correspond to urban areas characterized by higher summer temperatures than the immediate environment with differences between 5 and 10°C. Navigate to the Layer menu and select Add vector layer. The following dialog will pop up: Figure 3.6: Add vector layer window In the File Name field, indicate the path to the ilotschaleur.json file. The following layer will be displayed in QGIS: Figure 3.7: urban heat islands (UHI) of Montreal 3.4 Saving a layer We use the previously imported coordonnees-stations-rsqa.csv file to illustrate how to export a layer in a different format. Right-click on the name of the layer, select Export, then Save features As… The following dialog window will pop up. Figure 3.8: Save features as… window Select the format in which you want to export the layer. In this case, we have selected the widely used ESRI shapefile, we will use this layer in future recipes. Another commonly used format is GeoJson since it is compatible with web base applications. Indicate the path where the layer will be stored and give it a name. Indicate whether you want to add the saved file to the current project, and finally click on OK. 3.5 Reprojecting a layer Most of the time, the layers are not in a CRS that is more convenient for the operation in hand. QGIS offers on-the-fly reprojections for rendering the layers. However, when executing operations like spatial analysis, it is required that all layers be in the same CRS. This recipe is illustrated with the LIMADMIN.shp file that corresponds to the administrative limits of Montreal’s boroughs. Before executing a spatial analysis, it is recommended to reproject the layers to the most convenient CRS. Right-click on the name of the layer, select Export, then Save features As…. The following dialog window will pop up. Indicate the path where the layer will be stored and give it a name. If you tick the box Add saved file to map, the recently exported layer will be saved and added to the current project. Figure 3.9: Reprojecting a layer Click on the little globe to select the CRS in which the new layer will be projected. The following window will pop up: Figure 3.10: Selecting another CRS You can filter the CRS. In this case we will export the new layer in EPSG:6622, since it is the most accurate for Quebec. Click OK to confirm the selection of the CRS and click again OK to save the layer. "],
["data-treatment.html", "Section 4 Data treatment 4.1 Joining layer data 4.2 Cleaning up the attribute table", " Section 4 Data treatment 4.1 Joining layer data Another frequent task before executing spatial analysis with QGIS is to join an attribute table to a layer. To illustrate this task, we refer to the stations_rsqa.shp file generated in section 1 and the file pollutants_average_12_31_2019_13H.csv file. When we load the shapefile into QGIS we identify that this layer only contains information on the identification and location of stations that compose the Air Quality Monitoring Network (RSQA). Figure 4.1: Attribute table of stations_rsqa layer We realize another problem, the name (nom) and the address of the stations are not correctly displayed. In order to fix it, right-click on the name of the layer, and select properties. A window will pop up. Go to Source and change the Data Source Encoding to UTF-8. Finally, click on Apply to accept the changes. Figure 4.2: Changing encoding Now, import the pollutants_average_12_31_2019_13H.csv file. One kick method is to drag and drop the file from the file into QGIS. This works fine for this file; however, you also can use Add Delimited Text Layer to have more control on the importation. The pollutants_average_12_31_2019_13H.csv file reports the average concentration of criteria pollutants from December 23, 2013, at 12h. The units of concentration are indicated in the following table. Pollutant Unit CO ppm H2S ppb NO ppb NO2 ppb SO2 \\(\\mu g/m^3\\) PM10 \\(\\mu g/m^3\\) PM2.5 \\(\\mu g/m^3\\) O3 ppb In order to join the pollutants_average_12_31_2019_13H attribute table to the stations_rsqa layer, follow these steps: Right-click on the name of stations_rsqa layer, select Properties, then Joins from the dialog window. Figure 4.3: Layer properties window Click on the green + sign. The following window will pop up: Figure 4.4: Joining a layer table In this case, since we have imported only one attribute table, QGIS has already selected the Join layer. Specify the Join field and the Target field, which correspond to the keys that relate the shapefile layer and the data layer. In this example, NO_POSTE is the identifier of the stations in the data layer and Numéro st is the identifier of the stations in the shapefile layer. Furthermore, it is possible to select the fields that will be joined, and the prefix that will be used. Since there are no repeated columns, we just deleted the default prefix, which corresponds to the name of the layer. Click on OK, then on Apply to finish the joining. To verify that the join has worked, you can open the attribute table of the shapefile. To make this change permanent, you need to export the layer. After the join, the layer was exported as stations_rsqa_12_31_2013.shp. 4.2 Cleaning up the attribute table Sometimes, data imported into QGIS is not in the correct format, the name of columns is not self-explanatory, or we simply want to discard the columns that will not be used during the task in hand. The Refactor fields algorithm simplifies removing, renaming and converting the format of dbf tables in QGIS. This algorithm ca be accessed through the Processing Toolbox. The use of Refactor fields is illustrated with the stations_rsqa_12_31_2013.shp file that was generated in the previous section. Import stations_rsqa_12_31_2013.shp file Launch the Refactor field. It will detect the available layer in the current project. In this window we can identify the name of columns, the type of information they store, their length and precision. The columns corresponding to concentrations, such as CO, H2S, and NO, are currently stored as text (data type is string). This is not convenient, since we cannot do arithmetic with text. Furthermore, we may want to change the name of Numéro st field for Station. Figure 4.5: Refactor field window We change the name of the first three columns according to the following figure, and the type of columns corresponding to concentrations was set as Double (real number) with a length of 23 and a precision of 3. Click on Run to generate a new layer. Figure 4.6: Using the refactor field algorithm The generated layer is named by default Refactored, of course, you can change its name at your convenience. Figure 4.7: Saving the refactored layer "],
["data-preprocessing-steps.html", "Section 5 Data preprocessing steps 5.1 Clipping vectors", " Section 5 Data preprocessing steps 5.1 Clipping vectors In some cases, it is necessary than a layer covers only an area of interest. For this purpose, we can use a layer setting the extent we want to keep for a section of a layer. To accomplish this task, we use Clip from the Geoprocessing Tool. To illustrate the operation of clipping vectors, we will use quartier_limite.shp and LIMADMIN.shp files. Load both layers into QGIS. LIMADMIN.shp corresponds to the administrative limits of Montreal’s boroughs (last update in 2013); however, the polygons extent beyond the terrestrial limits. On the other hand, the quartier_limite.shp file corresponds to the former administrative limits, but the polygons cover only (approximately) the terrestrial limits. Figure 5.1: Montreal’s boroughs Navigate to Layer, then to Geoprocessing Tool, and select Clip. The following window will pop up. LIMADMIN.shp layer corresponds to the Input layer, since it is the layer we want to cut, whereas the quartier_limite.shp is the Overlay layer, the layer we will use to set the limits we want to keep. Figure 5.2: Using the clip algorithm Click on Run to generate a new layer. Save the clipped layer as limadmin_clipped.shp. "],
["data-exploration.html", "Section 6 Data exploration 6.1 Listing unique values in a column 6.2 Loading BaseMaps", " Section 6 Data exploration 6.1 Listing unique values in a column The List Unique values algorithm, from the Processing Toolbox, generates a table and a HTLM report of the unique values of a given layer’s field. To illustrate the use of the List Unique values algorithm, we will import the grandparcs.kml file. The field Generique2 stores the type of parks located in Montreal, and we would like to know the unique values without having to open the attribute table. Launch the List Unique values algorithm from the Processing Toolbox. It will identify the available layer in the current project. Click on … from the Target Field(s) and select Generique2. Click on Run to generate a temporary layer and a HTLM report. Figure 6.1: List unique values window 6.2 Loading BaseMaps When we import layers into QGIS, sometimes it is difficult to identify what the points, lines or polygons of a layer correspond to. In these situations, it is very helpful to add a base map to give some spatial context. One plugging that comes in hand to add spatial context is QuickMapServices. If it is not already available in your QGIS Desktop, navigate to Plugins, then to Manage and Install Plugins. In the window that has been displayed search QuickMapServices and click on Install Plugin. Figure 6.2: Manage and install plugins in QGIS To illustrate the use of QuickMapServices, load the stations_rsqa_12_31_2013.shp. Navigate to Web from the menu bar, select QuickMapServices, go to OSM, and select OSM_Standard. You will see the following set of air quality monitoring stations located in Montreal.
