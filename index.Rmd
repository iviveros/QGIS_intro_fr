# Introduction

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is an Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The aim of this document is to present some recipes about importing and exporting vectors, and treatment and exploration of spatial data. I expect to add some recipes on vector styling and map composition. 

This is a brief introduction to QGIS, as such it does not replace the [QGIS User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/). I also recommend you visiting the [StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) chanel, where you can get support on questions related to QGIS.

The data used to illustrate the recipes presented in this document come from the [Portail données ouvertes Montréal](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/); particularly, the selected data from this site is under the licence [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
