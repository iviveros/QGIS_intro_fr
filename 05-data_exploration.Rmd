##Listing unique values in a column

The **List Unique values** algorithm, from the **Processing Toolbox**, generates a table and a HTLM report of the unique values of a given layer's field. 

To illustrate the use of the **List Unique values** algorithm, we will import the `grandparcs.kml` file. The field **Generique2** stores the type of parks located in Montreal, and we would like to know the unique values without having to open the attribute table.

1. Launch the **List Unique values** algorithm from the **Processing Toolbox**. It will identify the available layer in the current project.

2. Click on **â€¦** from the **Target Field(s)** and select **Generique2**. Click on Run to generate a temporary layer and a HTLM report.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap='List unique values window'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/List_Unique_Values.png')
```

## Loading BaseMaps

When we import layers into QGIS, sometimes it is difficult to identify what the points, lines or polygons of a layer correspond to. In these situations, it is very helpful to add a base map to give some spatial context.

One plugging that comes in hand to add spatial context is **QuickMapServices**. If it is not already available in your QGIS Desktop, navigate to **Plugins**, then to **Manage and Install Plugins**. In the window that has been displayed search **QuickMapServices** and click on **Install Plugin**.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap='Manage and install plugins in QGIS'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/QuickMapServices.png')
```

To illustrate the use of **QuickMapServices**, load the `stations_rsqa_12_31_2013.shp`. Navigate to **Web** from the menu bar, select **QuickMapServices**, go to **OSM**, and select **OSM_Standard**. You will see the following set of air quality monitoring stations located in Montreal.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap="Montreal's Air Quality Monitoring Network"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/BaseMaps_Example.png')
```
